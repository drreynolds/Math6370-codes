# Math6370-codes

Codes for in-class collaboration for the course: Parallel Scientific Computing (MATH 4370/6370) at Southern Methodist University.

These codes require working C, C++11, and Fortran-90 compilers that support OpenMP, a working MPI installation (preferably with the `mpicc`, `mpicxx` and `mpifort` wrapper scripts and `mpiexec` launcher), and the "make" program, and are designed to be compiled/run at the Linux/OSX command line.
