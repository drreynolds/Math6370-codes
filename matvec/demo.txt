1. compile and run the serial version.
2. add in timers to see the relative work in each portion of the code.
3. parallelize the work sections one at a time, from slowest to
   fastest, running each on 2 threads.  Do the matrix-vector product
   in two ways:
     a. parallelize outer loop
     b. parallelize inner loop
4. show use of omp_get_num_threads() and omp_get_thread_num()
   functions
