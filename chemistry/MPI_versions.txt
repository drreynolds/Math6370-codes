Differences between various MPI versions of the code:

chemistry_mpi:
  Statically allocates a pre-defined number of cells to each
  processor.  Root processor sets temperature field, distributes
  values to procs, who compute local portions and return solution
  values to root.

chemistry_mpi2  (manager-worker)
  Dynamically allocates cells to each worker processor.  
  Distributes individual spatial entries to worker processors on a
  first-come-first-served basis (one entry at a time).  
  *Requires at least 2 processors

chemistry_mpi3  (manager-worker)
  Dynamically allocates cells to each worker processor.  
  Distributes individual spatial entries to worker processors on a
  first-come-first-served basis (in chunks).  
  *Requires at least 2 processors
  **If n is not a multiple (chunk*p), where p is the number of
    processors, it will do a little extraneous work
  ***Currently only works in Fortran
